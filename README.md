## About the APP
 Mobility for Everybody is an app designed to help people with mobility issues find accessible spaces in train carriages. The    app provides real-time information on the availability of these spaces, allowing users to plan their journey with confidence. It also offers additional features such as route planning, alerts for upcoming stops, and accessibility information for different train lines.
